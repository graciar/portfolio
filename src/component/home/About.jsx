                    I'm a student currently pursuing a degree in Informatics at President University, I’m actively learning and building projects focusing on the back-end.
                    My journey into development started through university projects, where I started using tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as React and Tailwind CSS. 
                    Currently, I focus on backend development and learn by working on hands-on projects.
                    For my concentration, I chose Cyber Security, and I spent a whole semester focusing on it. So, I got to learn a lot about keeping stuff secure.

                    While I don’t have official industry experience yet, I’ve worked on academic and self-initiated projects that have strengthened my skills and deepen my understanding of web development. 
                    I’m currently seeking internship opportunities where I can grow as a developer, collaborate with others, and contribute to real-world projects. You can find my resume <a href="#" className='underline hover:text-red-400'>here</a> for more details.
